## Guidelines for writing
- This project is intended to be a beginners guide. Explain technical terms where appropriate, but don't make it too simple. For
example, you don't have to explain what a partition is to someone who dual-boots Linux.
- :trollface: [Emojis](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) make reading more enjoyable: use them! (but not too much)
- :eyeglasses: Try to find official specifications to back up the information you write. Put the link to the reference at the top or bottom
of the article, so readers can look up more detailed information if they like.

If in doubt about anything, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/Omniscimus/Directory-Cheatsheet/issues)!
